  <h2>What Makes a Celebrity?</h2>
  <p>Celebrity is a reference to the fame and wide public recognition of an individual or a group, or, occasionally, a particular animal, as a direct result of the attention given to them by the mass media. Attaining Celebrity status is often associated with having wealth (i.e. having fame and fortune). Attaining fame through involvement in the field of sports or the entertainment industry are commonly associated with acquiring celebrity status, while political leaders often become celebrities. People may also become celebrities due to media attention on their lifestyle, wealth, or controversial actions, or even for their connection to a famous person.</p>
